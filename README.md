# MTS-IE — Multi-Domain Time-Series Intelligence Engine

MTS-IE is a modular, deployable machine learning system designed to ingest time-series data from multiple domains and perform **forecasting**, **anomaly detection**, and **uncertainty-aware simulation**.  
The project focuses on end-to-end ML system design, emphasising real-world applicability, model comparison, and decision-support under uncertainty.

## Target Domains

### 🏎️ F1 / Motorsports
Time-series analysis of motorsport telemetry, including lap-time trends, tyre degradation patterns, and strategy-relevant performance signals.

### 📈 Finance
Forecasting and analysis of financial time series such as prices and volatility, anomaly detection, and Monte Carlo–based risk and scenario simulation.

### 🏥 Health (Outbreak Analysis)
Population-level outbreak trend forecasting using disease incidence data, abnormal growth detection, and probabilistic scenario modelling for early-warning insights.  
*This module focuses on trend intelligence, not clinical diagnosis.*

## Core Capabilities
- Time-series preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Forecasting using statistical and deep learning models  
- Anomaly detection on temporal signals  
- Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty estimation  
- Explainability and visual analytics via an interactive interface  

## Project Goal
The goal of MTS-IE is to demonstrate **system-level machine learning engineering** across multiple real-world time-series domains, rather than optimising a single dataset or model.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "#### The ***2020* Formula 1 season** was a COVID-disrupted, 17-race championship defined by empty grandstands, double-headers, and extreme Mercedes dominance, with **Lewis Hamilton winning his 7th World Championship** to equal Schumacher after crushing the field in the W11, one of the fastest cars in F1 history; Mercedes won 13 of 17 races, while **Max Verstappen** was the only real challenger, dragging Red Bull to occasional wins, and the season also stood out for unexpected first-time winners like **Gasly** (Monza), **Pérez** (Sakhir), and **Ocon** (Sakhir), plus chaos at Ferrari who collapsed to midfield, making 2020 a **strange mix of *historical dominance* and *rare unpredictability***."

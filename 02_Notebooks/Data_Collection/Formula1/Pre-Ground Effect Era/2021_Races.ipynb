    "## Introduction\n",
    "#### The ***2021* Formula 1 season** was a fiercely contested, 22-race championship defined by an intense, season-long duel between **Max Verstappen** and **Lewis Hamilton**, culminating in one of the most controversial finales in motorsport history at Abu Dhabi, where Verstappen secured his **first World Championship** on the final lap; Red Bull and Mercedes were closely matched throughout the season, trading victories and momentum, while the year also stood out for multiple first-time winners such as **Ocon** (Hungary), **Ricciardo** (Monza), and **Norris** (Russia—nearly), dramatic incidents at Silverstone, Monza, and Jeddah, and a highly competitive midfield, making 2021 a **rare blend of *pure rivalry*, *high drama*, and *modern F1 controversy***.\n"

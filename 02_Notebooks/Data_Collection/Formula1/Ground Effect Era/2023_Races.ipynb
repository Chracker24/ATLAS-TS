    "## Introduction\n",
    "#### The ***2023* Formula 1 season** represented the full optimisation phase of the ground-effect regulations and was defined by an **unprecedented level of dominance from Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing**, who produced one of the most statistically overwhelming seasons in F1 history; Red Bull won **21 of 22 races**, with Verstappen securing his **third World Championship** in record-breaking fashion, while Ferrari and Mercedes traded sporadic podium contention amid inconsistent performance, tyre degradation challenges, and operational variability, and midfield teams experienced significant volatility under stable regulations, making 2023 a season characterised by **extreme competitive convergence at the front**, **regulatory maturity**, and **historical performance asymmetry**."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "#### The ***2024* Formula 1 season** marked a period of **competitive tightening within the mature ground-effect regulations**, with **Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing** remaining the benchmark but facing **increasing pressure from Ferrari, McLaren, and Mercedes**, as aerodynamic convergence, tyre management improvements, and operational execution narrowed performance gaps; the season was characterised by **greater race-to-race variability**, strategic complexity, and midfield teams occasionally challenging the front under specific conditions, making 2024 a year defined by **reduced dominance**, **strategic nuance**, and a grid operating closer to its regulatory ceiling ahead of the major 2026 reset."

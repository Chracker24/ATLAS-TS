    "## Introduction\n",
    "#### The ***2025* Formula 1 season** represented the **final and most saturated year of the ground-effect regulation cycle**, with teams operating at the limits of aerodynamic and operational convergence ahead of the 2026 reset; while **Red Bull and Max Verstappen** continued to be central reference points, the season was defined by **compressed performance margins**, increased strategic sensitivity, and heightened importance of execution over outright pace, as Ferrari, McLaren, and Mercedes capitalised on marginal gains, tyre management, and race-day decisions, making 2025 a season characterised by **regulation exhaustion**, **fine-grained strategic trade-offs**, and a grid finely balanced on the edge of a major technical transition.\n"
